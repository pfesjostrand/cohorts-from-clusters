# Recoding documentation ------------------------------------------------------
# 
# Notes on what/why recodings are made follow
#
#   1.1 Reasons for recoding
# 
# Recoding are done for two purposes. 1. To change categorical scales into ordinal scales when possible.
# 2. To change numeric missing value codes into NA. Recoding of missing values, 2, are done according to
# a prepepares spreadsheet for changing scales, 1, this is more nuisance than worth, therefore these are
# instead hardcoded below. If names of variables are changed names here should also be changed. 
# 
# 
#   1.2 How non-standard / missing values are recoded in cses_main data
# 
# CSES uses various numeric codes, 99, 9999 etc. to cocde for NON STANDARD responses such as resp. give
# no response, are not able to anwswer question, or record is missing. In some cases such numeric codes
# can be given an ordinal standard code based on the repsondents answer in other questions. In other 
# cases they are here changed to Rs standard code for missing value 'NA'. 
# 
# 
#   2.1 About party identication in cses_main                                                          
# 
# In CSES variable IMD3005_1 and IMD3005_2 resps. are asked if they are close to any party, if they 
# answer YES the resp. is asked to specify what party in IMD3005_3, and to rate how close in IMD3005_4,
# here named pid. Many resps. respond that they do not feel close to any party and these will
# be marked as a missing value i IMD3005_4 / pid. Recoding of this is done to avoid the missing
# values in IMD3005_4 / pid, as follows:
# 
#  2.2 How pid is recoded in cses_main 
# 
# If the resp. specify in BOTH IMD3005_1 and IMD3005_2 that they are not close to any  they are 
# marked as 0 in pid, as then they little ident. If the resp. specify that they are not close
# to any party in EITHER IMD3005_1 OR IMD3005_2 AND they either can not answer or is missing answer in
# IMD3005_3 then pid is recoded into 0. This makes the pid var ordinal. If pid has a standard 
# answer no recoding is done. I.e. no correction is made to achive consistency.
# 
# 
#  3.1 Explanation of non-unique and unique party IDs in cses_main
# 
# The data contains survey questions where the respondent is asked to rate parties on a scale, -5 to 
# +5. Answers are recorded in IMD3008_* variables; IMD3008_A contain ratings for the largest party, 
# IMD3008_B for the second largest and so forth. Treatment of this 
# 
# To use these ratings thios coding needs to be mapped to unique party ID. the IMD5000_* variables 
# supply party IDs for A, B and so forth. Thes IDs are numeric therefore in a mapping of a subset of 
# these numeric codes to more easily identifiable short names is done. This is pased on a pre-prepared
# preadsheet and only done for a subset of politys. 
# 
# Mapping is then done between the IMD5000_. and IMD_3008_. variables, by nesting the data on each 
# election. Then renaming each IMD3008_ variable by the unique ID or short name containd in IMD5000_.
# For each  election there  should be a unique value for IMD5000_A.
